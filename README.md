# AMPER: Autonomous Maze Pathfinding and Exploration Robot [WIP]
AMPER is a robot project in ROS.
The robot can can navigate mazes by solving for a path, then traversing the path to the target position.

## Future plans
- Use of a LIDAR sensor for navigation
- Currently the robot can only move one block forward or turn 90 degrees at a time. In the future the robot should calculate and traverse the fastest route without making unnecessary stops.
